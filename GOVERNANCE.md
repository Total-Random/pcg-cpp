# Project Governance

The **pcg-cpp** project (under the **Total-Random** organization) is a community-driven open-source project. Our goal is to maintain and modernize the PCG random number generator library for C++, ensuring it remains accessible, stable, and performant for everyone.

We believe that the best way to ensure the longevity of this project is to empower the community to take ownership.

## 1. Principles

*   **Openness:** All decision-making happens in public (GitHub Issues/Discussions).
*   **Meritocracy:** Influence is earned through active contribution and commitment to the project.
*   **Consensus:** We strive for consensus in all technical and governance decisions.

## 2. Roles

### Contributors
Anyone who contributes to the project is a Contributor. Contributions include:
*   Submitting Pull Requests (code, documentation, tests).
*   Reporting issues and reproduction steps.
*   Helping others in discussions.

### Maintainers
Maintainers are Contributors who have demonstrated a long-term commitment to the project's success. They have write access to the repository.

**Responsibilities:**
*   Reviewing and merging Pull Requests.
*   Triaging and managing Issues.
*   Ensuring code quality, CI stability, and release management.
*   Mentoring new contributors.

### Admins (Total-Random)
Currently, the **Total-Random** organization holds administrative access. However, our intent is to facilitate the technical leadership of the Maintainers. Admins will intervene only in critical situations (e.g., security, code of conduct violations).

## 3. Decision Making

Process for making changes:
1.  **Discussion:** Open an Issue or Pull Request to propose a change.
2.  **Review:** At least one Maintainer must review and approve the change.
3.  **Consensus:** For major changes (API breaking, governance), we seek lazy consensus (wait 72 hours for objections).

## 4. Becoming a Maintainer

We actively welcome new Maintainers. To become a Maintainer:
1.  Demonstrate consistent contributions (PRs, reviews, helpful comments).
2.  Express interest in helping maintain the project.
3.  Existing Maintainers will vote/agree.

## 5. Code of Conduct

All participants must adhere to our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to ensure a safe and welcoming environment.
